# Secret-key-sharing-task

Imagine a highly sensitive situation, such as a nuclear missile launch authorization system shared between two neighboring countries like India and Pakistan. In such a scenario, the decision to launch cannot rest in the hands of just one individual. Instead, multiple top-level officials (say 5 members) have access to a part of the launch code, but the system is designed such that only when a minimum of 3 out of the 5 members come together with their respective parts of the code, the missile launch can be triggered. This is a classic case of shared responsibility and controlled access to a powerful action. Now let’s translate this into a technical approach using cryptography.

This real-world situation can be addressed using a method called Shamir’s Secret Sharing algorithm. The purpose of this algorithm is to divide a secret (in our case, the missile launch key) into multiple parts or shares and distribute them among the trusted members. The beauty of this method is that any minimum number of shares, called the threshold, can be used to reconstruct the original secret. However, if fewer than the required number of shares are present, the secret remains unrecoverable. This prevents misuse and ensures collaboration and agreement among the authorized individuals.

In the example above, we assume that there are 5 members in total, and at least 3 are needed to reconstruct the original key. This is commonly referred to as a 3-out-of-5 threshold scheme.

The key idea behind Shamir’s algorithm is to use a polynomial. First, we treat the secret key as the constant term of a randomly generated polynomial of degree one less than the threshold. So if we need 3 members to access the secret, we create a polynomial of degree 2. Then, we choose random coefficients to complete the polynomial. For example, let the secret be 123. We can generate a random polynomial like 7x² + 5x + 123. Each member is then given a different point on this curve, such as evaluating this polynomial at x equals 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The (x, y) pairs form their shares.

When we need to reconstruct the original secret, at least 3 members bring in their shares. These values can be fed into a mathematical process called Lagrange interpolation, which allows us to find the original polynomial and recover the constant term — the secret key. Even if someone steals two shares, they will not be able to get any useful information about the original secret. This maintains the confidentiality and security of the system.

To ensure the integrity and trustworthiness of each share, we further secure the data by applying a cryptographic hash function such as SHA-256 to each (x, y) share. This generates a hash value that acts like a digital fingerprint. These hashes can be stored or verified later to check whether any share has been tampered with. If the hash of a given share does not match the stored hash, we know that the share is corrupted or fake.

Finally, when it is time to use the shares to reconstruct the secret, the system reads the evaluation input from a file like eval_input.json, checks the integrity of each share using the cryptographic hash, and then applies Lagrange interpolation on the valid shares to recover the original secret.

To summarize, this setup not only enforces collaborative access to a sensitive resource but also ensures that the system is resistant to tampering or unauthorized reconstruction. The combination of polynomial-based sharing, cryptographic hashing, and interpolation ensures that secrets are protected both mathematically and digitally, providing a secure and reliable mechanism for real-world applications.
